## Overview

Organoid intelligence (OI) uses living neurons grown on chips to perform computation, offering potential advantages in energy efficiency (up to 100,000x vs silicon) and adaptive learning. This emerging field bridges neuroscience, bioengineering, and robotics.

## Companies & Platforms

- [Cortical Labs](https://corticallabs.com/) - Australian startup behind DishBrain (800k neurons playing Pong in 5 min). Now shipping CL1, a desktop biological computer for code-deployable synthetic biological intelligence.
- [FinalSpark Neuroplatform](https://finalspark.com/neuroplatform/) - Swiss platform offering remote access to human brain organoids from $1k/month. Uses dopamine-based reward training with light-activated molecular cages.

## Research & Demonstrations

- [DishBrain (Cortical Labs, 2022)](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(22)00806-6) - First real-time demonstration of in vitro neurons learning to play Pong using electrophysiological feedback.
- [MetaBOC Robot (Tianjin University, 2024)](https://newatlas.com/robotics/brain-organoid-robot/) - Wheeled robot controlled by pea-sized brain organoid performing obstacle avoidance and tracking.
- [Organoid Drone Navigation (Sabanci University, 2025)](https://www.neuronovai.com/academic/article/organoid-intelligence-brain-like-computation-from-living-cells/) - Successful optimization of autonomous drone navigation using organoid-based control.
